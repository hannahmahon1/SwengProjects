# SwengProjects

This is the first project I have done as part of my Software Engineering module. The project is based on the Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm, first focusing on finding the LCA in a binary tree and then improving this code to work for directed acylic graphs. Both parts have been tested extensively as I focused the majority of my time on this project on testing.  
The code and the tests can be found within the LowestCommonAncestor file in the src file.
